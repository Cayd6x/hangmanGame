# Force Game in Python

This project is a simple implementation of the Force game in Python. The objective is to guess the hidden word, letter by letter.

## How to execute

To run this game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. The game is designed to run on any version of Python 3.

### Steps for Execution:

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where the game file is saved.
4. Run the command `python hangmanGame.py` to start the game.

##How to play

- The game starts by displaying a sequence of underlines, each one representing a letter of the hidden word.
- The player must try to guess the word, indicating one letter at a time.
- If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the corresponding positions.
- If the letter is not in the word, a part of the force will be drawn.
- The game ends when the player guesses the word or force is completely drawn.

## Personalization

You can add more words to the list of hidden words in the source code. To do this, edit the `escolher_palavra` function in the `hangmanGame.py` file.

Have fun playing!
